## <h1black>What You've </h1black><h1blue>Accomplished</h1blue>

In this hands-on lab, you've successfully built and deployed a complete **AI-powered call center analytics platform** using Snowflake Cortex AI and Snowflake Intelligence. Here's what you've mastered:

### <h1sub>Data Processing & AI Functions</h1sub>

✅ Loaded structured data from CSV files (50,000+ records)  
✅ Transcribed audio files using `AI_TRANSCRIBE` with speaker identification  
✅ Extracted text from PDF documents using `AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT`  
✅ Analyzed sentiment across customer interactions  
✅ Translated text to multiple languages for global teams  

### <h1sub>Advanced Analytics & ML</h1sub>

✅ Built semantic search services for call transcripts and support tickets  
✅ Created semantic models for natural language queries with Cortex Analyst  
✅ Developed an intelligent Cortex Agent combining multiple AI tools  
✅ Identified at-risk customers and calculated revenue impact  
✅ Analyzed network performance and infrastructure capacity  

### <h1sub>Snowflake Intelligence</h1sub>

✅ Created and configured a Cortex Agent with multiple tools  
✅ Used Snowflake Intelligence for conversational data exploration  
✅ Asked natural language questions across structured and unstructured data  
✅ Explored automatic tool routing and multi-source insights  
✅ Performed semantic search and queries with context awareness
