# CityFibre Operations Demo Script (Network & Delivery)

## Goal
Show how the agent answers network reliability, capacity, and delivery questions.

## Prompts to try
- “Show uptime and latency for the last 30 days by region; flag hotspots.”
- “List top 10 areas by install lead-time and the blockers (wayleaves/civils).”
- “Where do we need additional backhaul capacity for small cells/Open RAN?”
- “Give me RFS velocity vs plan and forecast to 8M premises.”
- “Summarise smart city/public sector connections in the past quarter.”

## Narrative
1) **Uptime/Latency**: Request trends; expect regional breakdown and hotspot notes.
2) **Install Lead Times**: Ask for median lead time by product (FTTP, DIA/Ethernet) and by region; discuss civils/permits.
3) **Capacity & Backhaul**: Ask about small cell/Open RAN backhaul capacity and where resilience upgrades are needed.
4) **RFS Velocity**: Ask for RFS vs plan (demo KPI table) and estimated date to reach 8M.
5) **Smart City/Public Sector**: Ask for recent CCTV/IoT/transport hub fibre turn-ups and any SLA/NPS notes.
