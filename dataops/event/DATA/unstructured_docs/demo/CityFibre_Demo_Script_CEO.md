# CityFibre CEO Demo Script (Exec Summary)

## Goal
Show instant answers on build progress, take-up, financing, partner performance, and network reliability using the CityFibre Executive Agent.

## Prompts to try
- “How many premises are RFS by region, and what’s our take-up percentage?”
- “Summarise the £2.3bn 2025 financing and how it accelerates reaching 8M premises.”
- “Which ISP partners are driving the most net adds this quarter?”
- “Show network uptime and latency trends for the last quarter.”
- “What smart city/public sector sites were connected in the last 90 days?”

## Narrative
1) **Coverage & RFS**: Ask for RFS by region vs target (4.6M RFS, target 8M). Expect a bar chart and penetration notes.
2) **Take-up & Partners**: Ask for net adds and partner contributions (Vodafone, Sky, TalkTalk, Zen, toob, Cuckoo). Highlight 620k connected and +102k H1 net adds (demo reference).
3) **Financing**: Ask the agent to summarise the £2.3bn July 2025 financing (equity + debt) and planned build acceleration.
4) **Network Quality**: Request uptime/latency; validate reliability vs FTTC message. Ask for any hotspot regions needing capacity.
5) **Smart City/Public Sector**: Ask for recent campus/CCTV/transport backhaul connections and NPS.
