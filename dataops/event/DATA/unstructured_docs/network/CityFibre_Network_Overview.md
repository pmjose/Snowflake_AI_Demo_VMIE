# CityFibre Network Overview (Demo)

## Footprint & Coverage
- 4.6M premises ready for service (RFS) as of June 2025; target 8M.
- Wholesale-only FTTP; dense metro rings plus long-haul backbone interconnects.
- Key regions: London/South East, Midlands, North West, Scotland, Wales; expanding nationally.

## Performance
- Speed tiers up to 5.5 Gbps; symmetric options for business.
- Reliability: fibre end-to-end; proactive monitoring/telemetry; designed for higher uptime vs FTTC.
- Typical metrics to report: uptime %, latency, jitter, packet loss, capacity utilisation.

## Services
- Access: FTTP for homes/SMB; DIA/Ethernet for business.
- Backbone: metro rings, resilient pairs, long-haul dark fibre.
- Mobile: 5G/4G backhaul, small cell/Open RAN fronthaul, edge DC access.
- Smart City/Public Sector: CCTV/IoT backhaul, campus fibre, transport hub connectivity, public WiFi backhaul.
- Cloud On-Ramps: AWS Direct Connect, Azure ExpressRoute, Google Interconnect (via partner PoPs).

## Resilience & Operations
- Architecture: diverse routes where available, resilient pairs for DIA/Ethernet, monitored backbone capacity.
- Incident response: NOC with proactive alerts; standard comms to ISP partners.
- Install lead times (illustrative for demo): FTTP homes ~10–15 days via ISP; DIA/Ethernet ~45–90 days depending on civils.

## Partners & Interconnect
- Wholesale ISP partners: Vodafone, Sky, TalkTalk, Zen, toob, Cuckoo (illustrative).
